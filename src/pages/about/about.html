        Med Expiration™ was designed for nurses, by nurses and technologists with one goal in mind - to help nurses administrator medications safely using  technologies that are already within arms reach.  We combined information available to the public from various pharmaceutical companies with mobile and web technologies to enable three main features:
    </p>

    <p>
        1. A General Medication Expiration Date Calculate<br/>
        2. An Insulin Expiration Date Calculator<br/>
        3. Monthly Medication Recall Alerts<br/>
    </p>
        
    <p>
        To use the General Medication and Insulin Expiration Date Calculators, all nurses have to do is enter details regarding the medication of choice (e.g. its  type, when it was opened, etc.), and within milliseconds, the date the medication expires will appear along with other notes about it that nurses may find useful.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Within the Monthly Medication Recall Alerts section, we share updates about medicine recalls on a frequent and regular basis. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Combined, these features create the Med Expiration™ and work together to help nurses administer medications safely.
    </p>

    <p>
        The General Medication Expiration Date Calculator is readily available within this app upon purchase and download. Once the app is purchased and an account is created, nurses can use the purchased app or login to our website using any device connected to the internet to access the General Medication Expiration Date Calculator.  Medications are added regularly and nurses can even suggest a medication not yet listed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        After the app is purchased and an account is created, nurses can also access The Insulin Expiration Date Calculator and Medication Recalls features with a low yearly subscription.
    </p>

    <p>
        Med Expiration™ was designed specifically with them in mind. We totally appreciate them and the work they do to help their patients and their families. As such, we wanted to help make their job a bit easier by providing critical information in an instant. Nurses even helped create and test it. We hope nurses everywhere like it and use it regularly.
